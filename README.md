# Zencart-Po-Box-Ban v1.6
This mod effectively bans PO Box addresses from being used on your store.

It works by comparing the customer's address at sign-up with a range of
words/letters often used with these addresses. Errors are displayed via the messageStack. The 'add shipping address' at checkout is also validated. 
Works with zencart 1.5.6c
